# 🧠 BRAIN — Glazy's Tools

The running log of this project. Everything we build, decide, and learn gets
jotted here so nothing is lost between sessions. Newest entries at the top.

**How to use:** after each meaningful change, add a dated bullet under a new or
existing date heading. Keep it short — what changed, and *why* if it wasn't
obvious.

## Project snapshot

- **What it is:** a personal workspace / web-IDE that hosts many AI-powered tools.
- **Not** a single app — the shell is generic; tools plug in via a registry.
- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4.
- **Key files:**
  - `src/lib/tools.ts` — tool registry (source of truth)
  - `src/components/workspace/` — shared IDE chrome (ActivityBar, Sidebar, TopBar, ToolPage)
  - `src/app/tools/<slug>/page.tsx` — individual tool pages
  - `docs/ADDING-TOOLS.md` — how to add a tool
  - `docs/RECOMMENDED-TOOLS.md` — libraries & tips

## Open questions / next up

- [ ] Decide which tool to build first (waiting on Glazy).

## 2026-07-07 — Workspace shell built

- Scaffolded Next.js 16 + React 19 + TS + Tailwind v4 in place (had to scaffold in
  a temp dir first — the folder name "Glazys Tools" fails npm naming rules).
- Built the reusable IDE shell:
  - **ActivityBar** (far-left icon rail: Dashboard, All Tools, logo).
  - **Sidebar** — searchable, registry-driven tool list grouped by category, with
    per-tool status dots and an empty-state message.
  - **TopBar** — breadcrumbs derived from the route + registry, local status pill.
  - **WorkspaceShell** — composes the three around the page content.
  - **ToolPage** — consistent header wrapper every tool page uses.
- Made tools **data-driven** via `src/lib/tools.ts`. Sidebar, dashboard, `/tools`,
  and breadcrumbs all read from it, so adding a tool is 1 entry + 1 page.
- Dashboard (`/`): hero, live stat tiles, and a dotted-grid empty state.
- Dark IDE theme with semantic color tokens in `globals.css`.
- Added project docs: `CLAUDE.md` (instructions), `docs/ADDING-TOOLS.md`,
  `docs/RECOMMENDED-TOOLS.md`, and this brain file.
- Verified: dev server runs clean, `/` and `/tools` return 200, screenshot looks good.
